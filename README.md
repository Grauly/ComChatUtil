# Com Chat Utils
This is a Minecraft Mod to solve the confusion of (not) being in community chat, developed specifically for The OG SMP (http://theogsmp.com/). It colors the text in your chat field green (or whatever color you choose), whenever you are in community chat.

## Reporting Bugs
Found a bug? A crash log is mentioning this mod? Managed to desync the community chat state?
Great! Kinda.

Either raise an issue on this repo, or let me know on discord, you will find me on the OG SMP Discord.

When reporting a bug, try and reproduce it first, there is little I can do without that.

When reporting a crash, make sure to append the crash report.

Managed to desync, and the mod is adamant you are/not in community chat? Relog.
After that, try and reproduce it, then report it as a bug.

## Notes
This mod is currently published nowhere except this repo, if you find it somewhere else - dont trust it. If the publishing state changes, I will amend that here.
